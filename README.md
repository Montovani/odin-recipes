# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)!

This is a simple recipe website built using basic HTML skills. The main goal is to apply everything I’ve learned so far in the **Foundations** course — especially HTML structure, elements, and internal linking.

## 🧾 Project Description

This website includes:

- A main landing page (`index.html`) with a list of recipe links.
- Individual pages for each recipe.
- Basic navigation between pages using anchor tags.

It’s a beginner-friendly project focused on understanding how to structure a website using only HTML.

## ✨ Features

- Clean HTML structure
- Internal links between pages
- Organized file and folder structure
- A fun way to learn and apply HTML

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
